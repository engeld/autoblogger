## FAQ

### Why did you use C as the programming language?
Because I can! Also, because my C is rusty and I wanted it to brush up using an interesting project I planned a long time ago. Maybe I'll change the programming language at some point, but for now it stays C.

### Why did you create this project?
I had this idea in my mind for a long time. When browsing on the net, I always keep a 'link.txt' text file for dumping interesting links. I always wanted to create a browsable place for those interesting links!
